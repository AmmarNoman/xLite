This is a major refactoring of the previous release (1.0.1) from
December 2015. Not only is this entirely based and buildt on Gradle in
Android Studio, but a huge number of bugs have been resoved and the
minimum API has  been pushed up, and improved compatibility with the
latest AOS API's.  In addition, since S.R.Labs are have put the
updates on hold and no  longer actively maintain SnoopSnitch. A
private developer has forked  and decided to excercise the apps FOSS
status to be able to continue  to provide the community with regular
